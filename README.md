# Server-Side Updates

## 1. Handling Multiple Students
- The server now handles grading multiple students concurrently using `Promise.all()`.
- Each student's data is processed by GPT-4 and grades are returned in a structured JSON format.

## 2. Structured GPT-4 Response
- The GPT-4 prompt has been updated to request responses in JSON format, making it easier to parse the grades for each section (Education, Professional Experience, Personal Statement, and Letters of Recommendation).

## 3. Improved Error Handling
- Errors in either database queries or GPT-4 processing are logged and returned gracefully to the client.
- If GPT-4 fails, a fallback response is generated to avoid breaking the server.

## 4. Logging and Debugging
- Logs were added to track student processing and GPT-4 responses, making it easier to debug issues.

## Files Updated
- **`index.js`**:
  - Updated to handle multiple student grading with structured JSON responses.
  - Logs added for better tracking.
- **`db.js`**:
  - No major changes, but ensure it provides the necessary student data for grading.
